        <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="about-text">
            Hi there! I'm Andrew, and I'm here to offer a listening ear and gentle support for life's ups and downs. As someone who deeply believes in the power of human connection, I'm passionate about creating a safe, non-judgmental space where you can freely express yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            I want to be upfront and clear that I am **not a licensed therapist or counselor**. I do not provide clinical therapy or mental health counseling. My role is to listen to your concerns, provide emotional support, and offer guidance based on life experience and empathy.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            I specialize in **active listening**—a practice where I focus on truly understanding what you're going through without judgment. My approach is about being present, giving you space to talk openly, and helping you navigate through challenges with confidence and clarity. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            Whether you're looking for guidance on personal growth, dealing with stress, or simply need someone to talk to, I'm here to support you. My intention is to offer thoughtful, non-clinical advice that can help you reflect, gain perspective, and feel empowered to make decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            It's important to understand that my support is not a substitute for professional therapy. If you're dealing with more serious mental health issues, I encourage you to seek out licensed professionals who can offer the clinical support you may need. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
            Thank you for considering me as a source of support. If you're ready to talk, I’m here to listen and offer whatever guidance I can. Let's work together to bring clarity and peace of mind into your life.
        </p>
